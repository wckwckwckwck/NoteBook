#### language evolution
1. The languages that programmers use today evolved through weveral generations of increasing <unl>sophistication</unl>.
<gre> n. sophistication | 事故(形容人)，高水品,复杂(指技术)

2. Sophistication is not a technical term.Computer scientists intead use the term abstaction,which in a broad sense<gre>广泛意义上</gre> removes detail and theoretically reduces complexity.When applied to programming languages,abstraction inserts a buffer between programmers and the chip-level details of instrction sets and binary data representaiton. As an analogy,think about driving a car with a manuala transmission that requires you to shift gears using a clutch and as tich shift.


#### Generation of languages
1. Third-generation languages ,such as COBOL and Fortran,were used extensively for business and scientific applications.
